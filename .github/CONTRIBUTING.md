# Contributing to **shinycal**

There are many ways to contribute to the ongoing development of the **shinycal** package!  Some contributions can be rather easy to do (e.g., fixing typos, improving documentation, filing issues for feature requests or problems, etc.) whereas other contributions can require more time and patience (like answering questions and submitting pull requests with code changes). Just know that that help provided in any capacity is very much appreciated. :)

## Filing Issues

If you believe you found a bug with the application, please include details on how you arrived at the bug (i.e. did you click on a certain input, choose a specific value, etc). If you found issues in the code itself, please include specific details on the location of the bug in the code base, and if possible create a reprex that demonstrates the issue. Details on creating a reprex in a Shiny app can be found in the [getting help section](https://mastering-shiny.org/action-workflow.html#getting-help) of [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html).

### Making Pull Requests

Should you consider making a pull request (PR), please file an issue first and explain the problem or feature idea in some detail. If the PR is an enhancement, detail how the change would make things better for the general user base of the application.
