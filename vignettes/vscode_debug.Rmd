## Obtaining metadata associated with streamers

The goal of this vignette is to illustrate how we can get interesting metadata associated with each streamer via the Twitch and YouTube APIs. 

## Setup

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(twitchr)
library(httr)
library(calendar)
library(caldav)
library(dplyr)
library(yaml)

print(getwd())
print(here::here())
readRenviron(".Renviron")
```

## Twitch streamer metadata

Hello during my stream

```{r twitchauth, eval=TRUE}
# set up authentication via environment variables
twitch_auth()
```
