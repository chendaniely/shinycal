# The Data Science StreamRs Calendar\!

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

In the last few years, we have seen an huge uptick in the number of data
science professionals and hobbyists who like to stream their projects
and share their knowledge with the community\! This calendar is my small
attempt to contribute back to this awesome community so you can see what
great streams are happening\!

This repository contains the Shiny app providing the streamers calendar,
created with the [`{golem}`](https://golemverse.org/) package. In
addition, this app would not be possible without the
[`{toastui}`](https://github.com/dreamRs/toastui) package by the fine
friends at DreamRs.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rpodcast/shinycal")
